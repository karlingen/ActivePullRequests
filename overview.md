# Overview
This extension allows you to view all active pull requests across all repositories for a team project. No more having to click through each repository just to see if an open pull request needs your attention. You can view all pull requests on one page and also sort and filter them out by different values.

Built completely using native design and appearance (Dark Mode - hurray!)
